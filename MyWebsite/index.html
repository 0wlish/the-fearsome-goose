  <h1>Geese</h1>
  <p>I was enjoying my walk by the Charles River, when I was confronted with a gaggle of geese. Click <a href="geese.html">here</a> to learn what geese are.</p>

  <caption><br>Here you can see the source of my misery</caption>
  <p>Geese <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2018/04/25/michigan-golfer-attacked-goose-opens-up-started-sprinting/549934002/">can and will</a> attack you, but if they do, it might be your fault. Be sure to avoid geese with goslings because they are very protective of their young.</p>
  <p>Watching their body language can help you anticipate their actions.</p>
  <p>Rule of thumb:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you see a goose, back away</li>
    <li>that's it lol</li>
  </ul>
